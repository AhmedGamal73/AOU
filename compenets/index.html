            It is an honour to be part of the Arab Open University (AOU) which
            was initiated by the late HRH Prince Talal bin Abdul Aziz in 1996 to
            be a unique educational and developmental project in terms of its
            goals and teaching methods. The establishment of the AOU stems from
            the belief that every human being in the Arab world has the right
            and capability to contribute to the national development in his/her
            country
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the inception of the AOU, many individuals, females and
            males, unfortunately, did not have an educational opportunity that
            would help them to contribute to their country’s development due to
            economic and social reasons, living in remote areas, time barriers,
            unavailability of time to study in traditional universities, etc.
            All these factors led to the birth of the idea of AOU as a higher
            educational institution under the umbrella of a non-profit
            developmental program (AGFUND) with the aim of building capable
            individuals in the Arab societies, who are equipped with science,
            knowledge and applied practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to achieve AOU’s unique objectives, the University adopted
            an educational system, the first of its kind in the Arab world. It
            is the Open Learning system, which utilizes modern technologies and
            digital means of communication, and eliminates time and space
            barriers. The AOU has succeeded in strengthening this learning
            system in the Arab world in partnership with the Open University in
            the UK which offers a wide range of accredited programmes locally
            and internationally. AOU’s graduates have proved their competence
            through gaining awards in local and regional competitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The University is pleased to provide educational services with
            reasonable tuition to the students of the Arab world in nine Arab
            countries. AOU will continue to achieve educational excellence and
            progress in spreading across the Arab countries, promoting its goals
            and unique mission. Thanks to the founder, and all of the
            contributors to shaping AOU’s journey, as well as the AOU successive
            presidents, and all academic and staff members. We pray to Allah
            Almighty to assist us in serving the University
          </p>
